    <h1>WEB</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
      is an information system where documents and other web
      resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
      which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible
      over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred
      via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed
      by users by a software application called a web browser, and
      are published by a software application called a web server.
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
      which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and
      upon whose technologies the Web is built.</p>
